Desktop Frames + creates **virtual Frames** on your desktop, allowing you to group and organize icons in a clean and convenient way. With enhanced visual effects and right-click options, it aims to provide a more polished and customizable user interface.


**Desktop Frames+** is an open-source alternative to Stardock Frames, originally created by HakanKokcu under the name BirdyFrames.

This project is a continuation and substantial modification of the original BirdyFrames codebase, which was licensed under the MIT License at the time of forking. 

Desktop Frames+ has been significantly enhanced and optimized for improved performance, stability, and user experience, while respecting the terms of the original license and acknowledging the original author.
